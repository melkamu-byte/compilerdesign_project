3. (Problem-solving): Draw the parse tree for the string "aba"
Given Grammar
S → aSa | bSb | c
Derivation of "aba"
1.	Start with S
2.	Use production: S → aSa
3.	Replace inner S with bSb
4.	Replace innermost S with c
Parse Tree
        S
      / | \
     a S a
        |
        S
      / | \
     b S b
        |
        c
Leaf Nodes (Left to Right)
a b c b a
This corresponds to the string "abcba", showing that "aba" cannot be derived from the given grammar.
✅ Conclusion
•	The grammar generates palindromes with center c
•	"aba" is NOT generated by this grammar
•	Therefore, no valid parse tree exists for "aba"
